Here's a brief explanation of the directory structure:

- cmd/server: Contains the main application entry point.
internal: Houses the core logic of the system, divided into workflow, block, and scheduler packages.
- pkg: Contains packages that could potentially be used by external projects, like the NATS client wrapper.
- api: For API-related code, such as HTTP handlers.
- config: For configuration-related code.
- scripts: For any build or deployment scripts.
